  I have always been fascinated by videogames and how they convey unique
  experiences. Therefore, I decided to make a career out of what have always
  been just a hobby.

    My studies gave me the technical foundation of game development: in middle
    school I have learned 3D modelling and C# programming while, during in high
    school, I learned physics, maths, computer technology and attended a drawing
    course.

    I furthered my studies at Abertay University, which provided me the
    principles of Game Design, teamworking skills and workflow methodologies.
    I have worked on several academic projects and game jams, few external experiences,
    on a wide range of game genres and consoles, within teams made by people with different backgrounds,
    covering roles such as artist, programmer and tester.
    As my academic path ended, I started working in Turin as a Game Designer.

    What I love the most of my job is supporting a game from concept to release,
    contributing with Design knowledge, prototyping skills, previsualisation
    techiques and unbounded passion.
