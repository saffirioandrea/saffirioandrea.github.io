  I have always been fascinated by videogames and how they convey unique experiences. I have been a video game player my entire life and therefore, I decided to make a career out of what have always been just a hobby.
</p>
  <p>
    My interest in game development in general has always been part of my academic path. I started to be interested in video game programming in middle school, when I was creating
    game mods through different programming languages, especially Python and Lua. At the same time, I began to learn the basis of 3D modelling for making small assets to include in
    my creations. At the beginning of high school, my understanding of 3D art and C# improved to the extent I could explore small game concepts and build basic prototypes.
  </p>
<p>
    I attended a Liceo Scientifico-Tecnologico, which means a high school focusing on STEM. As a consequence, I studied physics, maths and computer technology, improving my
    coding skills greatly. However, I felt I was neglecting the artistic aspect of game development, so I decided to attend a drawing course. During these years I learned how to
    draw characters and environments and the rules about perspective and image composition. At the time I needed to choose my university, I opted for a Game Design course, as I thought I had all the necessary tools to become a Game Designer.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the Abertay University, I was provided with principles of Game Design, teamworking skills and workflow methodologies. I experienced different Game Design aspects such as UX design, QA testinag and UI design by taking part of academic projects or initiatives of local companies. I attended several official game jams, many student projects and occasional workshops of Dundonian game studios. My University refined my knowledge to a professional standard and provided me with the necessary experience to work in the industry. As my academic path ended, I started working in Turin as a Game Designer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I have worked on several academic projects, game jams and few external experiences,
    experiencing a wide range of game genres and consoles. I was part of teams made of people with different backgrounds,
    eventually covering roles such as artist, programmer and tester but always contributing with Design knowledge,
    prototyping skills, previsualisation techiques and unbounded passion.
