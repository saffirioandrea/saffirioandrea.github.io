[//]: #About Description

I have been playing games all my life and I have always been fascinated by their way of providing unique experiences.
For this reason, I have decided to make a career out of what have always been just a hobby to me. During middle school I have
learned 3D modelling and programming in Unity and I high school I have studied physics, maths and computer technology, while attending a drawing course. My studies gave me the technical preparation to make prototypes on my own and in the end I have decided
to become a Game Designer. I have got accepted in one of the best university in Europe for my course, the Abertay University (Dundee), which provided me the principle of Game Design, teamworking skills and project methodologies.

What I love the most of my job is supporting a game from concept to release, to which I contribute with Design knowledge, prototyping skills and unlimited passion.
