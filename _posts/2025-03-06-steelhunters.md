## Project description

This is the first online multiplayer game I ever worked on. SteelHunters is still in development, so there is not much I can disclose about the project.

## My work

Up until today, I have been working on several different topics, but I also am the owner of the PvE part of the game. This involved communication with multiple departments, refactors, design work and a lot more. In general, I could sum up in bullet points:
- Creating new AI Behaviors using Unreal Behaviour Trees
- Designed, pitched and implemented systems to create PvE Entities
- Designed new features and behaviors to be later implemented through the custom system and BHT
- Designed and implemented other features of the games
- Worked on UI, ABP and other Unreal Engine features for prototyping and bugfixing.

I can expand on this... As long as it does not break my NDA!

## Takeaway from this experience

I learnt and have been learning a lot from working at DPS Studios. I was also granted the chance of teaching a class about Tech Design in Unreal Engine and mentor others, which surely added a lot to my professional growth in these years.
