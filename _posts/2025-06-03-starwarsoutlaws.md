Star Wars Outlaws was an incredible opportunity that I got for working with a team at a Level Design capacity. The ambitious project had plenty of main quests and side activities and a smaller team from Ubisoft Milan was tasked to work on several of those.

## Project description

The game of Star Wars Outlaws was set in a few planets - different locations - as well as outer space. The player must choose and side with some of the factions contending control of these areas, which are also involved in main quests. This was one of the biggest production I ever worked on, in terms of scope.

## Specifics of the project

* Made with Snowdrop.

* I worked mainly as a Level Designer and System Designer.

* My contribution was also outside of the limited scope of the "Milan cell", as I supported the implementation of gameplay elements used by other teams.

## My work

While working on the project at Massive, most of my work was about:

* Design and setting up levels layouts for some of the quests.
* Create gameplay elements specific for these quests.
* Create new elements to populate the environment (ambushes, animals wandering, etc).
* Create the logic for side - activities and balancing the encounters.
* Work alongside other departments to create specific assets for quests/side activities.
* Create and placing level design logic in levels according to metrics.

## Considerations

During my time working for Massive, I had the chance of working with one of the biggest team working on a single project. While my priority was supporting the needs of the Milan Team, I actually worked on systems that could be used by the wider team. This involved the design, validation and documentation of such systems.
Also, it was also the first time I officially worked as a Level Designer. In any case, it was not the first time I designed, greyboxed and created levels using level design tools, so it was not a new challenge, it was still a new experience since so many people were involved in the project.
Cooperating with many other departments while also being the technical support of a feature team was a great time for me as a developer, as I learned a lot about how projects this size work.
