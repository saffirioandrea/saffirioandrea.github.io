The Ambition of an Artist was part of the coursework of the module “Spatial Constructs”, which required to create a five-minute-long video of a game prototype. My work consisted of a narrative experience featuring puzzle solving and environmental interaction. Throughout the game, the player can access to worlds inside paintings and, by exploring them, finding clues and collecting information.

## Specifics of the project

- Made with Unreal Engine 4, Maya 2018 and Photoshop CC 2019
- Developed in 3 months.
- Programmed using Unreal Blueprints.
- My roles: designer, programmer, 3D artist.


(The prototype was developed for the creation of a mock playthrough, hence it is not meant to be playable, as it does not take into account a generic user playing it).

The project is a puzzle game with a focus on environmental exploration. Set at the end of the 19th century, the player impersonates the son of a famous painter, known as Ulysses, who went missing two years earlier. The main character has found his father’s family home, which was kept secret by the artist, and starts searching for clues about the fate of his missing parent. He soon finds out that Ulysses obtained a supernatural skill through an occult ritual: his paintings are worlds that can be entered and explored.

## Objectives

- Develop an interactive game set in a believable environment.
- Design a level consisting of a main section, the mansion, and two small parts, a forest and an ancient temple.
- Concept and develop a range of interactions with the game world.
- Achieve appeal through style, perspective, architecture, space, objects, materials, lighting and composition.
- Improve Unreal blueprints scripting skills by researching about custom post-process shaders.
- Design a satisfactory User Experience by developing a diegetic User Interface with narrative relevance.
- Manage and execute a game project.

<br>The project was intended to be a realistic previsualisation piece for presenting the prototype, which, as mentioned, was not intended to be playable to begin with. Instead, the module aimed to achieve appeal through style, perspective, architecture, space, objects, materials, lighting and composition.
<br><br>I have chosen Unreal Engine as the game engine for this project as I wished to improve my Unreal Blueprints scripting skills and intended to demonstrate my UX design knowledge by developing a diegetic User Interface with narrative relevance. Although the use of third-party assets was allowed in this module, I seized the opportunity to test my 3D and 2D art creation skills and made most of the environment myself. The 3D assets of walls and floors are modular and, as the majority of the assets in the level, they are built entirely using Maya 2019 and textured using Photoshop CC 2019.

## Player experience

Overall, The Ambition of an Artist is an intriguing game experience based on discovering the fate of a mysterious person by reading information, analysing clues and finding new way of accessing the secrets of his mansion. The gameplay experience was intended to be relaxing but nevertheless interesting. At the beginning of the game, the player enters an old Jacobean House, abandoned long ago. The most powerful tool the protagonist has at disposal is the Notepad, whose main purpose is to display the protagonist's’ thoughts and reasoning, while also helping the player by giving suggestions and clear tasks. <br><br>

<div class="col">
This tool can be accessed by pressing TAB and also allows the player to open the “Notes”, that is to say the deduction page. In this section, the Sentences collected by the user are displayed. Sentences may be added by interacting with objects, accessing into new areas or solving puzzles and are the main element leading the player in the game. By linking Sentences to each other, the character may unlock more questions or answers, which in turn grant a deeper understanding of the environment and the correct approach to puzzles. Moreover, correct deductions might also open new ways of interacting with the world or new character skills, encouraging the player to return to already explored parts of the map and find new, or previously inaccessible paths.
