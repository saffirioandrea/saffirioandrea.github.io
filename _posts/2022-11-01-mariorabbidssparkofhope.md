    Mario+Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is the sequel of Mario+Rabbids: Kingdom Battle. Produced by Ubisoft Milan, this is a Turn-based Strategy game that expands upon the foundations of the first game of the series. The exploration is quite more vast and varied, while the battle encounters are more dynamic thanks to a free-grid movement and the addition of the Sparks.

## My work

I am extremely proud of this game, as it was an important step in my career. During the development I learnt a great deal of notions regarding the field of Technical Design, a solid foundation of Data Structures, and how to work within a very large development team. The highlight of my experience are:

* As already mentioned, Data Structures and communication between Design and Programming departments

* Proposal and creation of Game Design features and modification

* Creation of prototypes to support proposal of Game Design features and introduction of new gameplay elements

* Documentation and monitoring of the creation of features across multiple departments

Most important aspects I contributed to: character and data creation, combat gameplay elements creation, Game Design, UI and UX technical reference and implementation.
